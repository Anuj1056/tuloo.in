# TODO: Make Homepage Images Fit Screen Size

## Plan Overview
- Adjust the slideshow CSS to remove the max-width restriction, allowing it to expand to the full width of its container for better screen fit.
- Add responsive styles for the slideshow height and overlay text to ensure proper display on different screen sizes, especially mobile.
- Optionally adjust the header logo image for responsiveness if it affects overall layout.
- Ensure the slideshow remains centered and functional across devices.

## Steps
1. **Update Slideshow CSS**: Remove max-width from .slideshow to allow full width within the container.
2. **Add Responsive Media Queries**: Add styles for mobile (max-width:600px) to adjust slideshow height and overlay text size for better fit.
3. **Adjust Header Logo**: Make the header logo image responsive to prevent overflow on smaller screens.
4. **Test Responsiveness**: Verify the slideshow fits the screen width and height adjusts appropriately on different devices.

## Dependent Files
- index (6).html (primary file to edit)

## Followup Steps
- Open the updated index (6).html in a browser and resize the window to test responsiveness.
- Check on mobile devices if possible.
- Note: Browser testing tool is disabled, so manual verification required.
